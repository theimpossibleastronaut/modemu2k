.SH DESCRIPTION
.\"
.B Modemu2k
is a TELNET client with a modem-like user interface.
It can redirect its I/O via a
.BR pty (4)
so that a comm program can handle the pty as a tty with a real modem.
.PP
.B Modemu2k
has two major modes: a command mode and online mode.
When invoked,
.B modemu2k
is in the command mode, waiting for AT commands input.
Entering a D or O command will put into the online mode, in which \" <===
.B modemu2k
communicate with a remote host.
Connection closing or a escape command input returns to the command mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.\" ===== -c =====
.TP
.BI -c " comm_prog"
Invoke a comm program \fIcomm_prog\fP.
.B Modemu2k
invokes it by passing /bin/sh an option `-c \fIcomm_prog\fP'.
Therefore, any
.BR sh (1)
commands can be specified.
The string \fIcomm_prog\fP can include a `%s',
which will be replaced with the
device name of the slave device after removal of the initial "/dev/".
.RS
Example:
.RS
modemu2k -c "xc -l %s"
.RE
.RE
.\" ===== -d =====
.TP
.BI -d " pty_master"
Open a file \fIpty_master\fP and talk through it.
A named pipe can be a
.I pty_master
as well as a pty master device because
.B modemu2k
doesn't ioctl a \fIpty_master\fP.
.\" ===== -e =====
.TP
.BI -e " atcmds"
Execute a series of AT commands \fIatcmds\fP initially.
.I Atcmds
must have an `AT' or `at' prefix.
D and O commands in \fIatcmds\fP are ignored.
.\" ===== -h =====
.TP
.B -h
Print a usage summary.
.\" ===== -s =====
.TP
.B -s
Print the last two letters of a device name.
The device is a pty master device which
.B modemu2k
talks through.
Therefore, when
.B modemu2k
prints `p8',
comm program must open /dev/tty\fIp8\fP.
.\" ==========
.PP
Note: The -c, -d, and -s options are exclusive of each other.
If two or more of the options are specified,
only the last one is effective.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMMAND MODE
.\"
Command mode expects lines in the following format:
.IP ""
[\fIgarbage\fP]\fIat\fP[\fIsp\fP][\fIcmd\fP[\fIsp\fP]]...\fIcr\fP
.PP
where
.I at
is an `AT' or `at',
.I sp
is spaces,
.I cr
is a carriage return character (register S3),
.I garbage
is a string includes no \fIat\fP.
If a `#' prefixes a line, the line is ignored.
Available
.IR cmd s
are listed below.
They are all case in-sensitive except for some literally used arguments.
A (*) marks default settings.
.\" ===== D =====
.TP
.BI D str
Dialing command.
Open a connection to \fIhost\fP.
If \fIport\fP is specified,
.B modemu2k
attempts to connect with the port instead of the default TELNET port,
and
doesn't initiate TELNET option negotiation.
The following formats are available for \fIstr\fP:
.RS
.TP
\fIhost\fP[:\fIport\fP]
\fIHost\fP is an Internet address in numbers-and-dots notation.
Optional \fIport\fP is a port number.
.TP
"\fIhost\fP[:\fIport\fP]["]
\fIHost\fP is an Internet address or host name.
Optional \fIport\fP is a port number or service name.
The closing double quote can be omitted if no command follows.
.PP
.I Str
can be prefixed with `T', `P', `\fIdigit\fPW' and/or `\fIdigit\fP,'.
The prefixes are simply ignored.
.br
Example:
.RS
ATDT0W127.0.0.1
.br
ATDP"foo.bar.jp:daytime

No dial-restriction or blacklisting capability so using modemu2k may be
unlawful in some countries.
