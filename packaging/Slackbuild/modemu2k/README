modemu2k adds telnet capability to a comm program. It can redirect
telnet I/O to a pty so that a comm program can handle the pty as a tty
with a real modem, and allows you to use a comm program's scripting
and file transfer features over telnet. Now supports IPv6 connections.

modemu2k is a fork of modemu, originally developed by Toru Egashira
