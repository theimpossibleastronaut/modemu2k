# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

modemu2k: modemu2k adds telnet capability to a comm program. It can redirect

modemu2k: tty with a real modem, and allows you to use a comm program's
modemu2k: scripting and file transfer features over telnet. Now supports IPv6
modemu2k: connections.
